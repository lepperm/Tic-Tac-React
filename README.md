This repository begins from the end of the React Tic-Tac-Toe tutorial, found here:

https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html

Per the tutorial, here are some ideas for improvements to add to the tic-tac-toe game listed in order of increasing difficulty:

* [X] Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
* [X] Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
* [X] Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
* [ ] Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
* [ ] When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
* [ ] When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.
